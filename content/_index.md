Welcome to the **Math Blog**. This site is in a very early stage of development,
but the plan is to introduce all math related topics with a focus on the most
important concepts taught in high school math classes. I hope everyone gets
something from it. The blogs are separated by category in the list below. Also,
check out my [personal page](https://coachshea.github.io) to see the other
projects that I enjoy working on.

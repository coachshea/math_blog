Welcome to the **Math Blog**. This site is in a very early stage of development,
but the plan is to introduce all math related topics with a focus on the most
important concepts taught in high school math classes. I hope everyone gets
something from it. Here are the blogs separated by category:

{{< ticks >}}
* Basic High School Algebra
* Advanced High School Algebra
* Geometry
* Pre-Calculus
* Probability and Statistic
* [Hugo](https://coachshea.github.io/math_blog/tags/hugo)

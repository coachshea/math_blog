My name is John Shea and I am a high school math teacher. I've been teaching
for 20 years and I have a Doctoral degree in Curriculum an Teaching.
  
Math is a challenging subject for many students and I love finding ways to
explain math concepts that help the ideas make sense to students. This website
is an attempt to reach out beyond my classes and help more students appreciate
and, dare I say, enjoy mathematics.

      <description>Enable Katex in the config file by setting the katex param to true. This will import the necessary Katex CSS/JS.
Note: Use the online reference of supported TeX functions.
Some math:
$$ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887… $$ $$ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887… $$
More math:
$$\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } $$ $$ \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } $$</description>

      <description>The below images are from the NASA Image and Video Library &amp;ndash; indulge yourself, revel in their beauty.
 The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Credits.    The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth and is Earth&amp;rsquo;s only permanent natural satellite.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>My name is John Shea and I am a high school math teacher. I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching for 20 years and I have a Doctoral degree in Curriculum an Teaching. Math is a challenging subject for many students and I love finding ways to explain math concepts that help the ideas make sense to students. This website is an attempt to reach out beyond my classes and help more students appreciate and, dare I say, enjoy mathematics.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://coachshea.github.io/math_blog/migrate-from-jekyll/</link>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
